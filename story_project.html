        <h2>What If Story Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project was a passion project from last year, created with a classmate. We explored the 
            concept of "what if our thoughts were shown." Over a month and a half, we put immense 
            effort into voice acting, recording reference clips with a professional video camera, and 
            editing, which was my primary role. The final product is a compelling narrative video, 
            showcasing our creativity and collaborative skills.
