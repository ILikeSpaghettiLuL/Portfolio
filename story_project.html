        <h2>UI/UX Design for School Chair</h2>
        <p>
            In this unique design-focused course, I ventured into UI/UX principles, moving away from the typical business-centric topics. 
            I developed a deep understanding of Figma, learning key design principles such as color theory, typography, and the effective use of whitespace. 
            Although the project presented initial challenges, I designed a minimalist, black-and-white interface for a school chair concept, which demonstrated 
            my growing expertise in the field. The end result was both sleek and functional, reinforcing my confidence in pursuing student jobs related to UI/UX design in the future.
