        <h2>Parking App Landing Page</h2>
        <p>
            I am truly grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through this web coding course. 
            This project was about making a webpage for a business idea we had, which mine was about a parking app 
            that helps its users find parking spots anywhere through park sensors connected with the app. This would allow 
            people in busy areas to instantly find a parking slot without having to drive around, 
            which would also help the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Delving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been an enlightening experience. 
            I applied these skills to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing landing page for a parking app, 
            demonstrating my ability to integrate web development techniques with design principles.
